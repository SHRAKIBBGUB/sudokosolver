# 🎯 Sudoku Solver - AI Project 🤖

## 📌 Overview
This project is a graphical Sudoku solver that implements three different artificial intelligence techniques to solve Sudoku puzzles:
1. 🔙 Backtracking Algorithm
2. 🧩 Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP)
3. ⚡ Hybrid Approach (Combining CSP + Backtracking)

The application features a user-friendly GUI built with Tkinter that allows users to input puzzles, solve them using different methods, generate random puzzles, and analyze solving statistics.

## ✨ Features

### 🧠 Solving Methods
- **🔙 Backtracking**: Classic recursive backtracking algorithm
- **🧩 CSP**: Constraint Satisfaction Problem approach with most constrained variable heuristic
- **⚡ Hybrid**: Combines CSP for deterministic moves and backtracking for guesses

### 🖥️ User Interface
- 🟦 Interactive 9x9 Sudoku grid
- ✅ Input validation to ensure only valid Sudoku numbers (1-9)
- 🟧 Visual distinction between 3x3 boxes
- 📊 Status bar for operation feedback

### 🧩 Puzzle Management
- ⏮ Load default puzzles
- 🧹 Clear the board
- 🎲 Generate random puzzles of varying difficulty
- 💾 Save puzzles to text files
- ✔️ Validate puzzle correctness before solving

### 📈 Statistics
- ⏱️ Time taken to solve
- 🔢 Total steps performed
- ↩️ Backtracking steps count
- 🧩 CSP steps count
- 🤔 Number of guesses made

## ⚙️ Requirements
- 🐍 Python 3.x
- 🖼️ Tkinter (usually included with Python)

## 🛠️ Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the Python file
2. Ensure you have Python 3 installed
3. Run the program with: `python sudoku_solver.py`

## 🎮 Usage
1. **✏️ Input a Puzzle**:
   - Enter numbers directly into the grid
   - Use "Load Default" for a sample puzzle
   - Generate a random puzzle with "Generate Random"

2. **🔍 Solve the Puzzle**:
   - Select a solving method (Backtracking, CSP, or Hybrid)
   - Click "Solve" to find the solution
   - View solving statistics in the popup dialog

3. **✔️ Validate the Puzzle**:
   - Click "Check" to verify the current puzzle is valid

4. **💾 Save/Load**:
   - Use "Save Puzzle" to save the current state to a text file

## 🏗️ Implementation Details

### ⚙️ Core Algorithms
- **🔙 Backtracking**: Standard recursive backtracking with brute-force guessing
- **🧩 CSP**: Uses most constrained variable heuristic and least constraining value ordering
- **⚡ Hybrid**: Uses CSP for cells with only one possible value, falls back to backtracking

### 🔍 Heuristics
- **🎯 Most Constrained Variable**: Chooses the cell with fewest possible values
- **📉 Least Constraining Value**: Orders possible values by how many constraints they impose

### 🗃️ Board Representation
- 9x9 grid stored as a list of lists
- Empty cells represented by 0

## 🧩 Examples

### 🏁 Default Puzzle
The application comes with a built-in default puzzle:

### 🎲 Random Puzzle Generation
The application can generate puzzles of three difficulty levels:
- 😊 Easy: 30-40 empty cells
- 🤔 Medium: 41-50 empty cells
- 😨 Hard: 51-60 empty cells

## ⚡ Performance Notes
- The ⚡ hybrid method typically performs best, using CSP where possible and backtracking only when needed
- 🔙 Backtracking alone can be slow for difficult puzzles
- 🧩 CSP performs well on puzzles with many constrained cells

## 📜 License
This project is open source and available for educational purposes.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements
- 📂 Add puzzle loading from files
- 🧠 Implement more advanced solving techniques like naked pairs/triples
- 👣 Add step-by-step solving visualization
- 📊 Include difficulty rating for input puzzles
